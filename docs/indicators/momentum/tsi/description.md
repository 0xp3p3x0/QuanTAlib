# TSI - True Strength Index

The True Strength Index (TSI) is like a precision scale for price momentum - it shows not just the direction and magnitude of price movement, but its underlying strength through double-smoothing both price change and its absolute value. Think of it as momentum with built-in signal clarity, designed to separate true price strength from market noise.

## Origin and Sources
**Creator**: William Blau developed TSI and introduced it in 1991 in Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities magazine.

**Historical Context**: Created to address the need for a momentum indicator that could clearly show both trend direction and underlying strength while minimizing false signals.

**Fun Fact**: Blau, a physicist by training, applied concepts from signal processing theory to create TSI, making it one of the first indicators to use sophisticated signal smoothing techniques.

## Core Concept
Think of TSI as measuring price momentum through a noise-canceling system. It tracks two things: price changes and the absolute values of those changes. By double-smoothing both and creating a ratio between them, TSI reveals the true strength behind price movements. Like having both a speedometer and an engine performance gauge, it tells you not just how fast price is moving, but how much power is behind the move.

*Pro Tip* ðŸŽ¯: Watch for TSI crossing its signal line while near extreme levels - these often provide the highest probability trading signals.

## Key Features
- **Double Smoothing**: Exceptional noise reduction in momentum readings
- **Bounded Oscillator**: Values typically range between +100 and -100
- **Signal Line**: Additional confirmation through crossovers
- **Center Line**: Clear trend direction reference at zero

## Real-World Application
### When to Use
- **Trend Direction**: Zero-line helps confirm trend
- **Momentum Confirmation**: Validate price moves
- **Divergence Trading**: Spot potential reversals
- **Entry/Exit Timing**: Use signal line crossovers

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Lag**: Double smoothing creates notable delay
2. **Complex Calculation**: More difficult to fine-tune than simpler indicators
3. **Multiple Parameters**: More variables to optimize
4. **Time Frame Sensitivity**: Different settings needed for different time frames

## Complementary Indicators
- **Price Action**: Confirm TSI signals with support/resistance
- **Volume**: Validate strength readings with volume
- **Trend Indicators**: Provide context for TSI signals
- **Volatility Measures**: Help qualify signal reliability

*Remember*: TSI is like having a sophisticated strength meter for price movements - it might take longer to give you a reading than simpler tools, but its double-smoothed signals can help you avoid false moves that trap other traders. Perfect for those who want to measure not just price momentum, but the quality of that momentum. Just don't expect it to catch every quick market move - sometimes being smooth means being slow.
