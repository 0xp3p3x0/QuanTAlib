# PO - Price Oscillator

The Price Oscillator (PO) strips price comparison down to its essence - it's simply the difference between two moving averages expressed in absolute terms. While its percentage-based cousin PPO gets more attention, PO speaks in the language traders understand best: pure price. Think of it as MACD without the complications, showing you the raw gap between fast and slow market movements.

## Origin and Sources
**Creator**: Evolved from early moving average crossover systems in technical analysis.

**Historical Context**: Developed as traders sought a simpler way to measure the spread between moving averages without percentage conversions.

**Fun Fact**: While less famous than MACD or PPO, PO is often preferred by futures traders and large position managers because its absolute price measurements help with position sizing.

## Core Concept
Think of PO as measuring the distance between two cars traveling at different speeds. The faster moving average is one car, the slower moving average is another, and PO tells you exactly how far apart they are in price terms. When they're getting further apart, momentum is building; when they're getting closer, momentum is waning.

*Pro Tip* ðŸŽ¯: Since PO uses absolute price differences, its signals need to be scaled relative to the price level - a 5-point spread means something very different on a $20 stock versus a $200 stock.

## Key Features
- **Absolute Measurement**: Shows moving average spread in actual price terms
- **Zero Line**: Clear trend direction indicator
- **Momentum Gauge**: Spread width indicates trend strength

## Real-World Application
### When to Use
- **Trend Direction**: Zero-line crossovers signal trend changes
- **Momentum Assessment**: Widening spread suggests strengthening trend
- **Position Sizing**: Use spread width to help scale position sizes

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Price Level Dependency**: Must adjust interpretation for price level
2. **Moving Average Lag**: Inherent lag from using two moving averages
3. **Scaling Issues**: Different markets need different interpretation scales

## Complementary Indicators
- **Volume**: Validate PO signals with volume confirmation
- **Price Action**: Use support/resistance to confirm PO signals
- **Volatility Indicators**: Help contextualize PO spreads

*Remember*: PO is like a market ruler measuring the gap between fast and slow moving averages in actual price terms. Its beauty lies in its simplicity - when the fast average pulls away from the slow, momentum is building; when they come together, momentum is waning. Just remember to adjust your ruler's scale to match your market's price level.
