# DMX - Directional Movement Index (Jurik)

The DMX is one of Mark Jurik's enhanced technical indicators, building upon Wilder's directional concepts through his innovative JMA (Jurik Moving Average) technology. Think of it as a high-definition version of traditional directional indicators - it applies Jurik's sophisticated filtering techniques to reveal clearer trend signals with less noise. Like upgrading from standard to high-definition TV, DMX offers a sharper, clearer picture of market direction.

## Origin and Sources
**Creator**: Mark Jurik developed DMX as part of his suite of enhanced technical indicators using JMA technology.

**Historical Context**: Created to address the limitations of traditional directional indicators in modern electronic markets, DMX represents a significant advancement in directional movement analysis through adaptive filtering techniques.

**Fun Fact**: The JMA technology behind DMX was developed after years of research into digital signal processing and its applications to financial markets.

## Core Concept
Think of DMX as a traditional directional indicator upgraded with advanced noise filtering technology. Using Jurik's adaptive smoothing techniques, it provides cleaner directional signals while maintaining responsiveness to genuine market moves. The result is an indicator that catches major trends but ignores much of the minor price noise that triggers false signals in traditional indicators.
