# PMO - Price Momentum Oscillator

The Price Momentum Oscillator (PMO) is like a momentum indicator with built-in smoothing superpowers. Created by Carl Swenlin, it's essentially a super-refined version of ROC (Rate of Change) that uses double exponential smoothing to produce exceptionally clean momentum signals. Think of it as momentum viewed through a premium lens - sharper, clearer, and more focused.

## Origin and Sources
**Creator**: Carl Swenlin developed PMO to address the noise issues in traditional momentum indicators.

**Historical Context**: Emerged from Swenlin's work on improving momentum measurements through careful optimization of exponential smoothing techniques.

**Fun Fact**: The PMO's formula was specifically designed to maintain sensitivity while eliminating the spiky, erratic movements that plague simpler momentum indicators.

## Core Concept
Think of PMO as a momentum indicator that's been sent to finishing school. It starts with simple ROC calculations but then applies two stages of exponential smoothing to refine the signal. The result is like having a momentum indicator with built-in noise cancellation - smooth enough to be readable, but responsive enough to catch important moves.

*Pro Tip* ðŸŽ¯: Watch the PMO signal line crossovers, but pay special attention when they occur near historical extreme levels - these often provide the highest probability signals.

## Key Features
- **Double Smoothing**: Two-stage exponential smoothing for cleaner signals
- **Signal Line**: Additional validation through signal line crossovers
- **Bounded Range**: Unlike raw momentum, PMO tends to stay within historical ranges

## Real-World Application
### When to Use
- **Trend Confirmation**: Validate trend strength with smooth momentum readings
- **Divergence Analysis**: Look for clear divergences with price
- **Overbought/Oversold**: Use historical extremes for mean reversion trades

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Smoothing Lag**: The price of smooth signals is some delay
2. **Range Shifts**: Long-term ranges can shift in strong trends
3. **Time Frame Conflicts**: Different time frames can show conflicting PMO signals

## Complementary Indicators
- **Moving Averages**: Frame the bigger trend context
- **Volume**: Validate PMO signals with volume confirmation
- **MACD**: Compare PMO's smooth signals with MACD for confirmation

*Remember*: PMO is like having a premium noise-canceling headset for momentum signals - it costs you a bit in terms of lag, but rewards you with crystal-clear readings of market momentum. Perfect for traders who value signal clarity over speed.
