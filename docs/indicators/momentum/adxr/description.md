# ADXR - Average Directional Index Rating

The Average Directional Index Rating (ADXR) takes the already powerful ADX and adds a time machine element. By comparing current trend strength to historical trend strength, ADXR helps traders spot shifts in trend momentum before they become obvious. Think of it as having both a speedometer and a speed history - it tells you not just how fast you're going, but whether you're accelerating or slowing down compared to a previous period.

## Origin and Sources
**Creator**: Another gem from J. Welles Wilder Jr.'s technical analysis toolkit, ADXR builds upon his original ADX indicator.

**Historical Context**: ADXR was developed to address a key limitation of ADX - the need for trend acceleration context. By comparing current and historical trend strength, ADXR adds a new dimension to trend analysis.

**Fun Fact**: Wilder was particularly proud of this refinement, noting that ADXR often signaled trend changes several days before they became apparent in price action.

## Core Concept
Think of ADXR as a trend momentum gauge. It compares today's trend strength to trend strength from a previous period (typically 14 days ago) to determine if trending momentum is building or fading. Like watching a car's acceleration rather than just its speed, ADXR helps you understand the changing dynamics of trend strength.

*Pro Tip* ðŸŽ¯: Look for ADXR divergence from price - when price makes new highs but ADXR makes lower highs, the trend might be losing steam despite appearances.

## Key Features
- **Trend Acceleration**: Measures whether trend strength is increasing or decreasing
- **Early Warning System**: Often signals potential trend changes before price confirmation
- **Momentum Context**: Adds historical perspective to current trend strength

## Real-World Application
### When to Use
- **Trend Quality Assessment**: Perfect for gauging whether a trend is gaining or losing momentum
- **Entry Timing**: Use strengthening ADXR readings to confirm trend trade entries
- **Exit Signals**: Weakening ADXR can signal time to tighten stops or take profits

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Whipsaw Risk**: Like a car's tachometer, readings can fluctuate rapidly in choppy markets
2. **False Signals**: Not every ADXR decline leads to a trend reversal
3. **Time Frame Tension**: Different time frames can show conflicting ADXR signals

## Complementary Indicators
- **ADX**: The foundation indicator - use ADXR to add acceleration context
- **Price Action**: Confirm ADXR signals with support/resistance breaks
- **Volume**: High volume with rising ADXR suggests strong trend momentum

*Remember*: ADXR is like having trend strength in stereo - comparing past and present to compose a fuller picture of market momentum. Use it to fine-tune your trend trading entries and exits, but always confirm with price action.
