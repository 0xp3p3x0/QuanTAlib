# ROC - Rate of Change

The Rate of Change (ROC) is momentum distilled to its purest form - it simply shows you the percentage change in price over a set period. Think of it as your market's speedometer, measuring how fast price is moving in percentage terms. Unlike complex oscillators, ROC gives you raw, unfiltered price velocity that's immediately comparable across any market.

## Origin and Sources
**Creator**: One of the oldest technical indicators, ROC emerged from early market observations about momentum.

**Historical Context**: Developed in the early days of technical analysis when traders needed a simple way to quantify price changes over time.

**Fun Fact**: While newer momentum indicators have added layers of sophistication, ROC remains popular in quantitative trading systems due to its simplicity and lack of lag.

## Core Concept
Think of ROC as your market's speedometer calibrated in percentage terms. It answers one simple question: "How much has price changed over X periods?" A 10% ROC means price is 10% higher than X periods ago; -10% means it's 10% lower. This simplicity makes it instantly comparable across any market or time period.

*Pro Tip* ðŸŽ¯: Watch for ROC divergence from price when both are making extremes - if price makes a new high but ROC doesn't, momentum might be waning.

## Key Features
- **Pure Momentum**: Unsmoothed, direct measurement of price change
- **Zero Line**: Clear trend direction indicator
- **Cross-Market Comparison**: Percentage basis allows direct comparison
- **Leading Indicator**: Often shows momentum shifts before price

## Real-World Application
### When to Use
- **Trend Strength**: Gauge momentum behind price moves
- **Divergence Trading**: Spot momentum/price disagreements
- **Market Comparison**: Compare strength across different securities
- **Trend Confirmation**: Validate price breakouts

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Noise Sensitivity**: Unsmoothed calculation means more whipsaws
2. **Period Selection**: Different lookback periods can give conflicting signals
3. **Base Effect**: Large past moves can distort current readings
4. **False Divergences**: Not all divergences lead to reversals

## Complementary Indicators
- **Moving Averages**: Smooth ROC for clearer signals
- **Volume**: Confirm momentum with volume
- **Price Action**: Use support/resistance with ROC
- **Volatility Indicators**: Context for ROC readings

*Remember*: ROC is like a high-performance car's speedometer - it gives you raw, unfiltered readings of market velocity. Its beauty lies in its simplicity and universality. Perfect for those who prefer their momentum straight up, no smoothing added. Just remember that sometimes a smooth ride might be preferable to a bumpy one.
