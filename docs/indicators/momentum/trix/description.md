# TRIX - Triple Exponential Average

TRIX is the momentum indicator that went to graduate school - it applies triple exponential smoothing to remove price noise while keeping the essence of the trend. Think of it as ROC with three layers of sophisticated filtering, designed to show you significant trends while ignoring minor price fluctuations. Its name comes from the "triple" smoothing process, not from any similarity to the breakfast cereal!

## Origin and Sources
**Creator**: Jack Hutson introduced TRIX in the 1980s through articles in Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities magazine.

**Historical Context**: Developed to address the need for a momentum indicator that could ignore minor price movements while remaining sensitive to significant trends.

**Fun Fact**: Despite its complex calculation, TRIX was one of the first indicators specifically designed to be calculated by early personal computers, making it a pioneer in the computational technical analysis era.

## Core Concept
Think of TRIX as a trend distillery - it takes price data and runs it through three rounds of exponential smoothing, then calculates the rate of change of the result. Like filtering water through multiple stages, each smoothing removes more noise, leaving you with purer trend signals. The final ROC calculation shows you how fast this purified trend is changing.

*Pro Tip* ðŸŽ¯: Use the zero line as your trend filter - when TRIX is above zero, the filtered trend is up; below zero, it's down. But the most powerful signals often come from divergences with price.

## Key Features
- **Triple Smoothing**: Exceptional noise reduction
- **Momentum of Trend**: Shows speed of trend changes
- **Zero Line**: Clear trend direction reference
- **Signal Line**: Additional confirmation through signal line crossovers

## Real-World Application
### When to Use
- **Trend Confirmation**: Validate longer-term trend changes
- **Divergence Trading**: Spot high-probability reversal setups
- **Filter**: Screen out minor market movements
- **Entry/Exit Timing**: Use zero-line or signal line crossovers

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Lag**: Triple smoothing means significant delay
2. **Whipsaws**: Even with smoothing, ranging markets can produce false signals
3. **Period Sensitivity**: Different lookback periods can show conflicting signals
4. **Over-filtering**: Can miss important shorter-term moves

## Complementary Indicators
- **Price Action**: Use support/resistance with TRIX signals
- **Volume**: Confirm trend changes with volume
- **Faster Indicators**: Balance TRIX's lag with quicker signals
- **Volatility Indicators**: Context for signal reliability

*Remember*: TRIX is like having a sophisticated trend-spotting algorithm from the 1980s - it might be slower than modern alternatives, but its triple-filtered signals can help you avoid false moves that trap traders using simpler tools. Perfect for position traders who want to focus on significant trends while ignoring market noise. Just remember that all that filtering comes at the cost of timeliness.
