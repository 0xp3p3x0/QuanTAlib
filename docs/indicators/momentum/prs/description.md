# PRS - Price Relative Strength

Price Relative Strength (PRS) is your market's performance comparator - it shows how one security is performing versus another by dividing their prices. Think of it as a financial tug-of-war scorer, keeping track of which security is winning the performance battle. Not to be confused with RSI (Relative Strength Index), PRS focuses on comparative performance rather than internal momentum.

## Origin and Sources
**Creator**: Evolved from early technical analysis practices of comparing different securities' performance.

**Historical Context**: Gained prominence in the 1950s and 1960s as sector rotation and relative performance analysis became key components of portfolio management.

**Fun Fact**: While simple in calculation, PRS became a cornerstone of modern sector rotation strategies and is a fundamental tool in the famous IBD (Investor's Business Daily) stock selection methodology.

## Core Concept
Think of PRS as a performance ratio calculator - it simply divides one security's price by another's (often an index or sector benchmark) to create a ratio. When the ratio rises, your security is outperforming; when it falls, it's underperforming. It's like having a continuous performance scoreboard.

*Pro Tip* ðŸŽ¯: The slope of the PRS line is often more important than its absolute level - accelerating relative strength often precedes significant outperformance.

## Key Features
- **Direct Comparison**: Clear view of relative performance
- **Trend Identification**: Shows leadership/laggard relationships
- **Rotation Detection**: Helps identify sector/stock rotation patterns
- **Strength Confirmation**: Validates breakouts through relative strength

## Real-World Application
### When to Use
- **Stock Selection**: Find strongest stocks within a sector
- **Sector Analysis**: Identify leading/lagging sectors
- **Portfolio Management**: Guide rotation decisions
- **Risk Assessment**: Monitor relative weakness for position sizing

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Base Selection**: Wrong comparison base can lead to misleading signals
2. **Time Frame Mismatch**: Different time frames can show conflicting relationships
3. **Correlation Assumptions**: High correlation periods can suddenly break down
4. **Volume Ignorance**: Price relationships without volume can mislead

## Complementary Indicators
- **Volume**: Validate relative strength moves
- **Moving Averages**: Smooth PRS for clearer trends
- **Momentum Indicators**: Confirm relative strength trends
- **Volatility Measures**: Context for relative performance

*Remember*: PRS is like a continuous performance scorekeeper for your markets - it tells you who's winning the performance game at any given time. Perfect for finding market leaders and avoiding laggards, but remember that today's winner isn't guaranteed tomorrow's championship.
