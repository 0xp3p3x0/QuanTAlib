# ALMA: Benchmark Analysis

This analysis evaluates the Arnaud Legoux Moving Average (ALMA) across four core benchmarks: accuracy, timeliness, overshooting, and smoothness. These benchmarks provide a comprehensive view of ALMA's performance characteristics and serve as a basis for comparison with other moving averages.

## Accuracy (closeness to the original data)

ALMA generally exhibits good accuracy in representing the original price data due to its Gaussian distribution-based weighting system.

- **Strengths**:
  - The Gaussian distribution weighting helps to reduce noise while preserving important price trends.
  - The offset parameter allows for fine-tuning of the balance between recent and historical data representation.

- **Considerations**:
  - Accuracy can vary based on parameter settings. Incorrect parameter selection might lead to over-smoothing or under-smoothing, potentially reducing accuracy.
  - In highly volatile markets, ALMA may sacrifice some accuracy for smoothness, especially if the sigma parameter is set to prioritize noise reduction.

## Timeliness (amount of lag)

ALMA is designed to minimize lag, which is one of its key advantages over traditional moving averages.

- **Strengths**:
  - The offset parameter allows ALMA to be more responsive to recent price changes, potentially reducing lag.
  - The ability to adjust the window size provides flexibility in balancing timeliness and stability.

- **Considerations**:
  - While ALMA generally has less lag than traditional MAs, it's not entirely lag-free. Some minimal lag may still be present, especially with larger window sizes.
  - The amount of lag can be influenced by parameter settings. Optimizing for minimal lag might come at the cost of increased noise sensitivity.

## Overshooting (overcompensation during reversals)

ALMA's design helps to mitigate overshooting during price reversals, but the extent can vary based on settings and market conditions.

- **Strengths**:
  - The Gaussian distribution weighting helps to dampen extreme price movements, reducing the likelihood of significant overshooting.
  - The sigma parameter allows for control over the smoothness of transitions, potentially minimizing overshoot.

- **Considerations**:
  - Overshooting can still occur, especially in markets with sudden, sharp reversals.
  - The degree of overshooting can be influenced by parameter settings. More aggressive settings (lower sigma, higher offset) might increase responsiveness but also the risk of overshooting.

## Smoothness (continuous 2nd derivative, less jagged flow)

ALMA generally produces a smoother line than many traditional moving averages, which is one of its defining characteristics.

- **Strengths**:
  - The Gaussian distribution weighting effectively smooths out minor price fluctuations and noise.
  - The sigma parameter provides direct control over the smoothness of the line.
  - The resulting smooth line can make trend identification easier.

- **Considerations**:
  - The degree of smoothness can be adjusted through parameter settings.
